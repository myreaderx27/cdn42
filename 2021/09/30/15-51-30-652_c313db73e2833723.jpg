We had, um, a lot of feedback on the site, but that was one of the more amusing comments and I think it &#8212; perhaps unintentionally &#8212; gets to something deeper about the $1,000\/$1,500 robot. Astro exists at this kind of perfect nexus of Amazon hardware efforts, from Ring security to Echo Show.<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday\u2019s common refrain of \u201cAlexa on wheels\u201d isn\u2019t entirely off-base. Astro is a kind of baby step into a world of more ubiquitous home robotics. There\u2019s a consensus among many that we\u2019ll get there in five, 10 or 15 years, but the most immediate question is how we get there &#8212; which is to say, what are the immediate stepping stones? For iRobot, it\u2019s leveraging the home mapping of robotic vacuums and using that in tandem with home assistants like Alexa or Google. For Amazon, Alexa is that foundation.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2208853\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2208853\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2208853\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0230.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0230.jpg 6720w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0230.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0230.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0230.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0230.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0230.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0230.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0230.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2208853\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>These are both fairly solid foundations from the standpoint of relative ubiquity. Pulling from some third-party research from last year, around a quarter of U.S. adults live with a smart speaker, and of those, almost 70% use Alexa. But even with numbers like that, the jump from Echo to Astro is still a big one. But credit to Amazon for giving it a go, even if its track record has made many consumers understandably weary of the messenger.<\/p>\n<p>I spent a little time with Astro last week ahead of the launch and was impressed by what Amazon put together here. I wasn\u2019t $1,500 worth of impressed. Pricing is going to be a pretty big hump to get over here (all of the caveats about that eventually coming down if Amazon can scale it), but the built quality is high and Astro is a clever combination of existing Amazon product lines, a few years of hard work and some clever workarounds like the periscope camera that pops out of the robot\u2019s head.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2210511\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2210511\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2210511\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-9.22.39-AM.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-9.22.39-AM.jpg 3042w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-9.22.39-AM.jpg?resize=150,73 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-9.22.39-AM.jpg?resize=300,146 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-9.22.39-AM.jpg?resize=768,375 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-9.22.39-AM.jpg?resize=680,332 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-9.22.39-AM.jpg?resize=1536,749 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-9.22.39-AM.jpg?resize=2048,999 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-9.22.39-AM.jpg?resize=50,24 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2210511\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ad, Astro<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>There are questions swirling around whether a $1,500 robot can ever be a mainstream product from a company that trades in consumer electronics commodities (hell, I ask one below), but there&#8217;s a sense in which that is almost besides the point. It seems extremely unlikely that there will be an Astro in every home, but it does mean that Amazon is able to plant a flag here. Sure Samsung shows off a bunch of helper robots each year at CES, but until proven otherwise, they amount to little more than hypotheticals.<\/p>\n<p>With Astro, Amazon announced a robot that&#8217;s going on sale soon &#8212; price prohibitive and invite-only as it may be. There&#8217;s a sense in which that&#8217;s a win in and of itself. Certainly Amazon hardware ambitions won&#8217;t live or die by the Astro&#8217;s success. Once they begin rolling out, the company could potentially have access to the largest wide scale home robotics trial for anything without a vacuum attached.<\/p>\n<p>As Amazon Device VP Charlie Tritschler notes in our conversation below, Astro finds the company taking the first step toward a broader world of home robotics. Ultimately, Amazon&#8217;s consumer robotics might not look like Astro at all.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Let\u2019s start with the \u2018why.\u2019 Why is this something Amazon is actively pursuing?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Given the fact that Amazon is always focused on customer experience, one of the things we look at is what are the upcoming technologies that can impact what\u2019s available? In a senior meeting a few years ago, we were talking about just that. We talked about AI, computer vision, processing power. One of the topics that came up was robotics. How have robotics changed to make it possible now for consumers. We have a lot of experience using robotics in our fulfillment centers, of course, and we thought about what can we do to make robotics in the home more convenient for consumers or provide peace of mind as part of the experience. That started us thinking about it, and by the end, we were saying, \u2018does anyone in the room think that we won\u2019t have robots in the home in five to 10 years?\u2019 And everyone said, \u2018yeah, we will.\u2019<\/p>\n<p><strong>Obviously there are already Roombas in a lot of homes, but those are robots that do one very specific thing. I assume you began by looking beyond that application?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The three big things that we saw ourselves that were confirmed with our beta testers were home monitoring &#8212; that\u2019s both security and the ability to check in on the home remotely. The second is the ability to care for loved ones, especially when they\u2019re remote and you can\u2019t care for them all the time. And the third was Alexa: being able to take Alexa and being able to add intelligent mobility to give it new capabilities around the home.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2208842\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2208842\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2208842\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0265.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0265.jpg 6720w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0265.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0265.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0265.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0265.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0265.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0265.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0265.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2208842\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p><strong>How much of the robot was built from scratch?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Tough to give you a specific number, but the vast majority of it.

But we recognized as we started doing the work that to conquer the domain that is is the home &#8212; every home is different, every home changes all the time, as people move things around, put things down, drop a chair on the floor, put a backpack somewhere.

So the overall complexity of the experience from a development perspective and all of the interdependencies between different systems were some of the biggest areas we had to overcome.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What has the primary failing of home robotics been to this point?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I don\u2019t think it\u2019s failings. I think it\u2019s just that we\u2019ve taken a slightly different approach, which is we focused on what the end value is that we\u2019re trying to create. And then we brought to bear all of the learnings that we have as Amazon with our robotics abilities and then applied all of our Amazon assets as well, like Alexa, Ring, Alexa Care or Amazon Kids.<\/p>\n<p><strong>At what point was it clear this is something you could\/should bring to market?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We had the vision of it early on, but I think for me it was the very first time I saw it actually navigate a room by itself. Up until then, we thought we could do it. We\u2019re smart people, we\u2019re working on it. But to see it actually happen and move gracefully and avoid obstacles, when you place something in front of it. I knew that some of the core things that had to be true to make this work were achievable.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2209216\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2209216\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2209216\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/astro_media_on-white_03.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/astro_media_on-white_03.png 8000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/astro_media_on-white_03.png?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/astro_media_on-white_03.png?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/astro_media_on-white_03.png?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/astro_media_on-white_03.png?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/astro_media_on-white_03.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/astro_media_on-white_03.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/astro_media_on-white_03.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2209216\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Amazon<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p><strong>Were there any major failings in the testing process that caused you to circle back?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There were[\u2026] SLAM, for instance, took a long time to get to the point where we could get it working well enough.

That data set indicated that Indian startups raised $6.3 billion, a quarterly record.<\/p>\n<p>Today, we ran India-focused queries <a href=\"http:\/\/pitchbook.com\">in PitchBook<\/a>, keeping the data set constrained to venture-backed companies with their HQ in the country. We pulled both Q2 and Q3 numbers for this year, though, of course, the Q3 number is not quite finished; there are a few hours left.<\/p>\n<p>The PitchBook query for Q2 Indian startup fundraising activity came in a little bit above ($6.81 billion) where CB Insights pegged the data. That PitchBook has a larger number for India&#8217;s Q2 a few months <em>after<\/em> CB Insights closed the books on its Q2 report is not surprising. Venture capital data is laggy, and quarters tend to fill in over time.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless, with both $6.3 billion and $6.8 billion numbers for Indian venture capital fundraising in Q2, we have a good base to compare against for Q3. Which, per PitchBook data, includes more rounds and <em>far\u00a0<\/em>more capital. Indeed, Indian startups have raised $17.23 billion, PitchBook reports, across some 459 deals in the third quarter.<\/p>\n<p>Those numbers will wiggle around as PitchBook adds in what&#8217;s left in the quarter and cleans up the data. But regardless of whether we prefer the $6.3 billion or the $6.8 billion Q2 number, it <i>appears<\/i> that India&#8217;s startups utterly crushed previous venture records in the third quarter.<\/p>\n<p>What does that tell us?

That means \u201cAI-first B2B startups that apply deep tech to novel data sets coupled with workflow automation. Most importantly these startups do so without introducing unintended race, gender or age bias while addressing data privacy and security concerns and providing transparency.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe believe that the success of AI will be how effectively startups address these ethical issues,\u201d Bose added. \u201cThere is a lot of fear about AI \u2014 some people associate it with \u2018The Terminator\u2019 movie, a loss of jobs or that \u2018Big Brother\u2019 is watching, and one of the challenges that happened is that there isn&#8217;t regulation on ethics right now.

The average check size for a seed is $2 million and $4 million for a Series A, he added.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to AI ethics, when Eric Benhamou founded the firm in 2004, he also had a vision of immigrants helping immigrants, Bose said. As such, the company has offices in Palo Alto, Tel Aviv, Paris and Mumbai. Six out of the full-time nine investment team members are immigrants, and all three general partners are immigrants. In terms of the investments, BGV\u2019s portfolio makeup is 95% immigrant entrepreneurs and 60% outside Silicon Valley.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cImmigration is a natural byproduct of our investment strategy,\u201d Bose added. \u201cWe needed a diverse team, and we have already lived the journey of the entrepreneurs we invest in. We can empathize and understand what they have to do. We also believe that today, 50% of employees are minorities, and if you have a lack of diversity, you will miss out.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote

surgery company, announced a $45 million Series B round on Thursday. The round comes during a critical year for Activ Surgical. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s in the process of developing new tools that give surgeons the ability to see otherwise invisible structures, and has plans to roll out those tools in the coming months.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first of those tools is the company\u2019s hardware component, called ActivSight, which allows surgeons to see things that would otherwise be invisible, like blood flow through microscopic vessels inside tissue. The hardware, which received FDA 510(K) clearance in<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.activsurgical.com\/news\/fda-clearance\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> April of 2021<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, fits between any type of endoscope and a white light camera system.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the push of a button, ActivSight already allows features like blood flow (usually invisible, unless injectable dyes are used) to light up like a Christmas tree. But unlike injectable dye methods, ActivSight can visualize blood flow in real-time (i.e the images of tissue change color if blood flow slows or stops).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the only system in the world, that intraoperatively can visualize things like blood flow without the injection of any dyes,&#8221; <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">says CEO Todd Usen.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This most recent round, will be used to support the commercialization of ActivSight, which is expected to go live in hospital systems in seven states in Q4 2021 or into next year. It will also be used to help glean a CE certification \u2013 a marketing clearance that allows medical devices to be marketed in Europe \u2013 which will allow ActivSight to roll out in seven European countries in 2022. Finally, the round will support the buildout of Activ\u2019s more ambitious AI-based projects, which will allow the ActivSight devices to identify even more key structures for surgeons who use it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The round of funding was led by Cota Capital. Incuding Cota Capital, the round will bring seven new investors to Activ Surgical: BAM Funds, Magnetar Capital, Mint Ventures, Castor Ventures, Dream One Vision and NVIDIA. The company has raised $77 million in funding so far.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Activ Surgical first made headlines in 2016 for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.science.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1126\/scitranslmed.aad9398?keytype2=tf_ipsecsha&amp;ijkey=d78e1d9e122f1287c9599b650012ea86cff6b70c\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">creating a robot<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that performed the first totally autonomous suturing of soft tissue. The company\u2019s founder Peter Kim holds a patent for a type of robot assisted surgery himself. But despite this, the company isn\u2019t focused on building robots.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhile robots are great, they\u2019re only used in about 10 percent of minimally invasive surgeries. A robot can reach things that a human can\u2019t but, until this point, a robot cannot see anything that a human can\u2019t,\u201d Usen says.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, the company is investing in tools that make surgeons themselves more savvy. Usen likens ActivSight\u2019s current approach to installing a rear view camera on a car.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cYour rearview camera on your car can see things that you can\u2019t down below, then it will start beeping. When a robot can start identifying things a human can\u2019t, that\u2019s when robotics will really take off. That\u2019s what Activ is doing, and that\u2019s what our our robotic partner surgeons are excited about.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ActivSight has already shown that it can be used in the operating room. It\u2019s been <a href=\"https:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov\/ct2\/show\/NCT04633512\">tested in a\u00a0<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">clinical trial on 70 patients at the University of Texas Health Science Center and the University of Buffalo. The results of those trials have not yet been released, but the company expects to publish data from that trial in October, a company PR confirmed to TechCrunch.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the ActivSight system <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">has <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">already gleaned FDA 510(k) clearance, which means it will be rolling out in several hospital systems this year. Those include seven systems in New York, Buffalo, Texas, Ohio and Florida.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The commercial deployment of ActivSight is just the first step for Activ Surgical. The goal is to ultimately collect a unique intraoperative dataset based on surgeries completed with ActivSight.\u00a0 Then, a software suite called ActivInsight, would analyze the data collected, and apply machine learning algorithms to help identify even more features that would otherwise be invisible to surgeons.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe have the most unique dataset anywhere in the world,&#8221; says Usen.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0\u201cFrom that we\u2019re able to do autonomous annotation and label key structures. It\u2019s collecting nerve identification, veins versus arteries, key critical structures \u2013 that information will be annotated and labeled using machine learning, and then fed back to anyone using the ActivInsight module on their scope.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This machine learning application won\u2019t be rolled out right away. Usen expects ActivInsight prototypes to be used in patients for the first time in 2022.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With this round of funding, those first steps will be set in motion.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Activ Surgical, a Boston-based digital surgery company, announced a $45 million Series B round on Thursday.

class=\"contributor-byline__bio\">\n\t\tChelsey Colbert is policy counsel at the <a href=\"https:\/\/fpf.org\/\">Future of Privacy Forum<\/a>. Chelsey leads FPF\u2019s portfolio on mobility and location data, which includes connected and automated vehicles, ride-sharing, micromobility, drones, delivery robots and mobility data sharing.\t<\/div>\n\t\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><p id=\"speakable-summary\">In recent years, rows of electric scooters and bikes lining sidewalks have become a common sight in cities around the United States.<\/p>\n<p>The size of the e-scooter market alone is expected <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bcg.com\/en-il\/publications\/2019\/promise-pitfalls-e-scooter-sharing\">to surpass<\/a> $40 billion by 2025, and Americans have taken more than <a href=\"https:\/\/nacto.org\/shared-micromobility-2019\/\">342 million<\/a> trips on shared bikes and e-scooters since 2010.<\/p>\n<p>Micromobility services generate a massive amount of mobility data, including potentially sensitive precise location data about users. Data from mobility services can provide valuable and timely insights to guide transportation and infrastructure policy, but the sharing of sensitive mobility data &#8212; between companies or between and with government agencies &#8212; can only be justified if issues of privacy and public trust are first addressed.<\/p>\n<p>Innovative mobility options are providing cities with opportunities to solve the <a href=\"https:\/\/escooternerds.com\/last-mile-transportation-electric-scooter\/\">last-mile transportation problem<\/a>, and the data from these services has a range of <a href=\"https:\/\/policydata.numo.global\/\">productive uses<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It can help city planners design transportation improvements, such as protected bike lanes, to keep users safe. Access to mobility data gives community advocates and government officials the ability to know in nearly real time how many mobility devices are in a certain area so cities can enforce limits to ensure neighborhoods are not overcrowded or underserved. This data can also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.openmobilityfoundation.org\/about-mds\/\">streamline communications<\/a> between companies and city governments, making it easier for mobility services to quickly adapt to events and emergencies in cities.<\/p>\n<p>However, there are valid privacy concerns over the granularity and quantity of data that digitally enabled mobility services are able to collect and request to share with governments.<\/p>\n<p>For example, a recent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aclusocal.org\/en\/cases\/sanchez-v-los-angeles-department-transportation\">lawsuit<\/a> filed against the Los Angeles Department of Transportation and the City of Los Angeles alleges that the city\u2019s collection of e-scooter trip data through the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.openmobilityfoundation.org\/about-mds\/\">Mobility Data Specification<\/a> violates the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act. A lower court <a href=\"https:\/\/clinic.cyber.harvard.edu\/2021\/08\/03\/clinic-files-technologists-brief-in-ninth-circuit-scooter-privacy-case\/\">dismissed the lawsuit<\/a> and the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the ACLU of Northern and Southern California recently asked a federal appeals court to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eff.org\/press\/releases\/eff-aclu-urge-appeals-court-revive-challenge-los-angeles-collection-scooter-riders?s\">revive it<\/a>.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Additionally, a bill recently <a href=\"https:\/\/leginfo.legislature.ca.gov\/faces\/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB859\">introduced<\/a> in the California Legislature would require specific conditions to be met before mobility data is shared with public agencies or contractors. Under this bill, data could only be shared to assist transportation planning or protect the safety of users. The bill also requires that any trip data must be more than 24 hours old before being shared.<\/p>\n<p>Near-real-time <a href=\"https:\/\/fpf.org\/blog\/a-closer-look-at-location-data-privacy-and-pandemics\/\">location data<\/a> is often required to fulfill valid safety and regulatory enforcement purposes, but this data is very sensitive because it could reveal intimate aspects of an individual\u2019s life. Patterns in location data could indicate personal habits, interpersonal relationships or religious practices.<\/p>\n<p>While it is possible in some cases to \u201cde-identify\u201d location data tied to a specific individual or device, it is incredibly difficult to truly make any data set of precise location history truly anonymous. Even highly aggregated location data about patterns of large groups of people can unintentionally reveal sensitive information.<\/p>\n<p>In 2017, a \u201cglobal heat map\u201d of user movement in the Strava fitness app inadvertently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/strava-heat-map-military-bases-fitness-trackers-privacy\/\">revealed the location<\/a> of deployed military personnel in classified locations. Location data, even when de-identified or aggregated, should be subject to checks and controls to ensure the data remains protected and private.<\/p>\n<p>Local governments and mobility companies are taking these issues of user privacy seriously. Over the past few months, the<a href=\"https:\/\/fpf.org\/\"> Future of Privacy Forum<\/a> has worked with SAE\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/mdc.sae-itc.com\/\">Mobility Data Collaborative<\/a> and public and private stakeholders to create a<a href=\"https:\/\/fpf.org\/blog\/fpf-and-mobility-data-collaborative-release-resources-to-help-organizations-assess-the-privacy-risks-of-sharing-of-mobility-data\/\"> transportation-tailored privacy assessment tool<\/a> that focuses on considerations for organizations that want to share mobility data in a privacy-sensitive manner.<\/p>\n<p>The Mobility Data Sharing Assessment (MDSA) provides organizations in both the public and private sectors with operational guidance to conduct thoughtful, in-depth legal and privacy reviews of their data-sharing processes. Organizations that use this tool for sharing mobility data will be able to embed privacy and equity considerations into the design of mobility data-sharing agreements.<\/p>\n<p>The goal of the MDSA is to enable responsible data sharing that protects individual privacy, respects community interests and equities, and encourages transparency to the public. By equipping organizations with an open-source, interoperable, customizable and voluntary framework that includes guidance, the barriers to sharing mobility data will be reduced.<\/p>\n<p>This is the first version of the MDSA tool; it focuses specifically on ground-based mobility devices and location data. Some mobility vehicles like e-scooters now come equipped with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/technology\/2020\/11\/19\/e-scooter-pedestrian-detection-voi\/\">on-board cameras<\/a>, so in the future, the MDSA may be appended to add guidance about images and video collected by mobility devices.<\/p>\n<p>The MDSA tool is open source and customizable, so organizations sharing this type of mobility data can edit it to consider the risks and benefits of sharing sensor or camera data that includes images.<\/p>\n<p>Micromobility services can play a key role in improving access to jobs, food and health care. However, there are multiple factors for companies and government agencies to consider before sharing mobility data with other organizations, including the precision, immediacy and type of data shared. Organizations must assess these factors in a thoughtful, structured manner that considers any potential sources of bias.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s the key to using mobility data to maximize the benefits of services in the short term and build their infrastructure in the long term, allowing people to move about cities safer and faster.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Innovative mobility options provide cities with opportunities to solve the last-mile transportation problem, and the data from these services has a range of uses, but there are valid privacy concerns.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":133574483,"featured_media":2210098,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[],"carmot_uuid":"61bbb3a9-fd32-3065-b307-82a7cf2b1b63"},"categories":[25515,352,426637499,17396,2401],"tags":[60506495,420205246,576638690,3279,576601853,11701],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/GettyImages-1184380945.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/2XX4QWt","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"premiumContent":false,"premiumCutoffPercent":1,"featured":false,"subtitle":"","seoTitle":"","editorialContentProvider":"","seoDescription":"","tc_cb_mapping":[],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[2210053],"hide_featured_image":false,"canonical_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/30\/sharing-mobility-data-without-compromising-privacy\/","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2210068"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2210068"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2210068\/revisions"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/chelsey-colbert"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2210068&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/133574483"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2210098"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2210068"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2210068"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2210068"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=2210068"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=2210068"},{"taxonomy":"tc_ec_category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_ec_category?post=2210068"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=2210068"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":2210053,"name":"Chelsey Colbert","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/chelsey-colbert\/","description":"Chelsey Colbert is policy counsel at the <a href=\"https:\/\/fpf.org\/\">Future of Privacy Forum<\/a>.

Most recently they have created an audio augmented reality experience to assist with exploring an unfamiliar environment. It recognizes things in the world and places them in 3D space. When wearing headphones, items will be announced from their position in the room, such as the word &#8220;chair&#8221; coming from the chair itself. Users can place virtual audio beacons on objects to track the location of the door, for example, and use the haptic proximity sensor to feel the outline of the room.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of this is made possible by combining the latest advances in AR, computer vision and the iPhone 12 Pro&#8217;s lidar sensor.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Sight Tech Global, Shaikh will discuss the Seeing AI team&#8217;s work to combine these remarkable technologies that promise to improve the independence of folks with vision loss, and describe the team&#8217;s latest steps toward this audio augmented reality experience, and paint a vision for the future of assistive agents.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don&#8217;t forget to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/e\/1FAIpQLSfberR7NW3F74cBNleiOVauGQ8wrSV0FcZqf1HH5X60mUrS6Q\/viewform\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/e\/1FAIpQLSfberR7NW3F74cBNleiOVauGQ8wrSV0FcZqf1HH5X60mUrS6Q\/viewform&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1633015242487000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFYrWaYGskT0MQWNDjw1im9s8Cr-w\">register now<\/a>.

Or, rather, let\u2019s talk about a lack of arms. It\u2019s a common thread between <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/03\/04\/the-lonely-death-of-jibo-the-social-robot\/\">Jibo<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/08\/21\/kuri-maker-mayfield-robotics-will-cease-operations-in-october\/\">Kuri<\/a> and now Astro. I suppose one could make the argument that <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/05\/the-owner-of-ankis-assets-plans-to-relaunch-cozmo-and-vector-this-year\/\">Anki\u2019s Cozmo<\/a> had arms of a kind, but the overhead forklift wasn\u2019t good for much beyond hooking into a proprietary block.<\/p>\n<p>Arms &#8212; or, rather, mobile manipulators, are hard. They\u2019re a second-generation problem. Or maybe a third or fourth. Once you\u2019ve proven out that enough people are interested in your new little home robot, then you can have those frank discussions about how much R&amp;D you want to dump into a pair of arms that can dust the counter and make sure your magazines are in an orderly pile without breaking down every two days. Maybe arms are when you start scanning the periphery for possible startup acquisitions.<\/p>\n<p>To hear Amazon talk about it, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/28\/why-amazon-built-a-home-robot\/\">Astro was created<\/a> without the aid of acquiring any specific companies. A lot of &#8220;ground up&#8221; development was required for what has thus far been a four-year project, most notably, the in-house development of a SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) system, so the robot knows where it is and where it\u2019s going. And while the department worked with Amazon Robotics, the company\u2019s industrial automation wing born out of its 2012 purchase of Kiva Systems, on-board technology from its autonomous cart system Canvas apparently didn\u2019t factor in.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2191371\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2191371\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2191371\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/actuator-blue.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/actuator-blue.jpg 3200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/actuator-blue.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2191371\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Bryce Durbin\/TechCrunch<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p><em>Don\u2019t forget to sign up to get the upcoming\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/newsletters\">free newsletter version<\/a>\u00a0of Actuator delivered to your inbox.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Credit to the person on Twitter who compared Astro\u2019s look to a tablet mounted on a vacuum canister. We had, um, a lot of feedback on the site, but that was one of the more amusing comments and I think it &#8212; perhaps unintentionally &#8212; gets to something deeper about the $1,000\/$1,500 robot. Astro exists at this kind of perfect nexus of Amazon hardware efforts, from Ring security to Echo Show.<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday\u2019s common refrain of \u201cAlexa on wheels\u201d isn\u2019t entirely off-base. Astro is a kind of baby step into a world of more ubiquitous home robotics. There\u2019s a consensus among many that we\u2019ll get there in five, 10 or 15 years, but the most immediate question is how we get there &#8212; which is to say, what are the immediate stepping stones? For iRobot, it\u2019s leveraging the home mapping of robotic vacuums and using that in tandem with home assistants like Alexa or Google. For Amazon, Alexa is that foundation.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2208853\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2208853\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2208853\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0230.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0230.jpg 6720w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0230.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0230.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0230.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0230.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0230.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0230.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0230.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2208853\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>These are both fairly solid foundations from the standpoint of relative ubiquity. Pulling from some third-party research from last year, around a quarter of U.S. adults live with a smart speaker, and of those, almost 70% use Alexa. But even with numbers like that, the jump from Echo to Astro is still a big one. But credit to Amazon for giving it a go, even if its track record has made many consumers understandably weary of the messenger.<\/p>\n<p>I spent a little time with Astro last week ahead of the launch and was impressed by what Amazon put together here. I wasn\u2019t $1,500 worth of impressed. Pricing is going to be a pretty big hump to get over here (all of the caveats about that eventually coming down if Amazon can scale it), but the built quality is high and Astro is a clever combination of existing Amazon product lines, a few years of hard work and some clever workarounds like the periscope camera that pops out of the robot\u2019s head.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2210511\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2210511\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2210511\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-9.22.39-AM.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-9.22.39-AM.jpg 3042w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-9.22.39-AM.jpg?resize=150,73 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-9.22.39-AM.jpg?resize=300,146 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-9.22.39-AM.jpg?resize=768,375 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-9.22.39-AM.jpg?resize=680,332 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-9.22.39-AM.jpg?resize=1536,749 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-9.22.39-AM.jpg?resize=2048,999 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-9.22.39-AM.jpg?resize=50,24 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2210511\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ad, Astro<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>There are questions swirling around whether a $1,500 robot can ever be a mainstream product from a company that trades in consumer electronics commodities (hell, I ask one below), but there&#8217;s a sense in which that is almost besides the point. It seems extremely unlikely that there will be an Astro in every home, but it does mean that Amazon is able to plant a flag here. Sure Samsung shows off a bunch of helper robots each year at CES, but until proven otherwise, they amount to little more than hypotheticals.<\/p>\n<p>With Astro, Amazon announced a robot that&#8217;s going on sale soon &#8212; price prohibitive and invite-only as it may be. There&#8217;s a sense in which that&#8217;s a win in and of itself. Certainly Amazon hardware ambitions won&#8217;t live or die by the Astro&#8217;s success. Once they begin rolling out, the company could potentially have access to the largest wide scale home robotics trial for anything without a vacuum attached.<\/p>\n<p>As Amazon Device VP Charlie Tritschler notes in our conversation below, Astro finds the company taking the first step toward a broader world of home robotics. Ultimately, Amazon&#8217;s consumer robotics might not look like Astro at all.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Let\u2019s start with the \u2018why.\u2019 Why is this something Amazon is actively pursuing?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Given the fact that Amazon is always focused on customer experience, one of the things we look at is what are the upcoming technologies that can impact what\u2019s available? In a senior meeting a few years ago, we were talking about just that. We talked about AI, computer vision, processing power. One of the topics that came up was robotics. How have robotics changed to make it possible now for consumers. We have a lot of experience using robotics in our fulfillment centers, of course, and we thought about what can we do to make robotics in the home more convenient for consumers or provide peace of mind as part of the experience. That started us thinking about it, and by the end, we were saying, \u2018does anyone in the room think that we won\u2019t have robots in the home in five to 10 years?\u2019 And everyone said, \u2018yeah, we will.\u2019<\/p>\n<p><strong>Obviously there are already Roombas in a lot of homes, but those are robots that do one very specific thing. I assume you began by looking beyond that application?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The three big things that we saw ourselves that were confirmed with our beta testers were home monitoring &#8212; that\u2019s both security and the ability to check in on the home remotely. The second is the ability to care for loved ones, especially when they\u2019re remote and you can\u2019t care for them all the time. And the third was Alexa: being able to take Alexa and being able to add intelligent mobility to give it new capabilities around the home.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2208842\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2208842\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2208842\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0265.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0265.jpg 6720w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0265.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0265.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0265.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0265.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0265.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0265.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0265.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2208842\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p><strong>How much of the robot was built from scratch?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Tough to give you a specific number, but the vast majority of it. We learned a lot, especially early on in the program, from other parts of the company. We already had robotics experience, like Amazon Robotics, who primarily focus on the fulfillment center and are looking at efficiency and making jobs easier. But we recognized as we started doing the work that to conquer the domain that is is the home &#8212; every home is different, every home changes all the time, as people move things around, put things down, drop a chair on the floor, put a backpack somewhere. So the team started looking at that and we realized we had to create our own SLAM experience.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Nothing on the robot was the direct result of an acquisition?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yeah.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It struck me that Amazon\u2019s purchase of Canvas would make sense from the standpoint of creating this fully autonomous [robot].<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If there\u2019s tools that make sense &#8212; if there\u2019s a simulation tool or other pieces, of course we will take advantage of those internal capabilities wherever possible, but the unique demands of creating a robot for the home means that we really did have to do a lot of invention to create the solution for consumers.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2208851\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2208851\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2208851\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0273.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0273.jpg 6720w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0273.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0273.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0273.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0273.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0273.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0273.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/CMC_0273.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2208851\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p><strong>What were the biggest challenges in developing Astro?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Where can I start? One of the topics is just figuring out how do you conquer the technical problems. There were just so many places where we really needed to invent and create, which is hard to predict. You have to go in and start the work. We had many places during the development where we would go down a path, stop, come back, start, rethink and redo. So the overall complexity of the experience from a development perspective and all of the interdependencies between different systems were some of the biggest areas we had to overcome.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What has the primary failing of home robotics been to this point?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I don\u2019t think it\u2019s failings. I think it\u2019s just that we\u2019ve taken a slightly different approach, which is we focused on what the end value is that we\u2019re trying to create. And then we brought to bear all of the learnings that we have as Amazon with our robotics abilities and then applied all of our Amazon assets as well, like Alexa, Ring, Alexa Care or Amazon Kids.<\/p>\n<p><strong>At what point was it clear this is something you could\/should bring to market?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We had the vision of it early on, but I think for me it was the very first time I saw it actually navigate a room by itself.

But to see it actually happen and move gracefully and avoid obstacles, when you place something in front of it.

clinician support app, Streams, which was developed by DeepMind and the London-based Royal Free NHS Trust starting in 2015.<\/p>\n<p>The Streams app was rolled out for use by clinicians at the Royal Free and a handful of other NHS Trusts. However, the Royal Free was <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/07\/03\/uk-data-regulator-says-deepminds-initial-deal-with-the-nhs-broke-privacy-law\/\">sanctioned in 2017<\/a> by the U.K.&#8217;s data protection watchdog, the ICO, for breaching data protection rules when it passed patients&#8217; sensitive medical information to the Google-owned company during the development phrase of the app.<\/p>\n<p>In a press release today, Mishcon de Reya described the lawsuit as an &#8220;important step in seeking to address the very real public concerns about large-scale access to, and use of, private health data by technology companies&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It also raises issues regarding the precise status and responsibility of such technology companies in the data protection context, both in this specific case, and potentially more generally,&#8221; the firm added.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>During the height of the COVID-19 crisis last year, the U.K. government inked <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/05\/uks-covid-19-health-data-contracts-with-google-and-palantir-finally-emerge\/\">a number of health data processing contracts with tech giants, including Google and Palantir<\/a> &#8212; and those deals have also faced concern and criticism over a lack of transparency.<\/p>\n<p>The government is also <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/09\/uk-dials-up-the-spin-on-data-reform-claiming-simplified-rules-will-drive-responsible-data-sharing\/\">consulting on whether to reduce the level of data protection<\/a> afforded to U.K. citizens, as it seeks to diverge from the European Union&#8217;s gold standard of privacy by design and default, set out in legislation such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"pbfn1qw10l\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/09\/uk-dials-up-the-spin-on-data-reform-claiming-simplified-rules-will-drive-responsible-data-sharing\/\">UK dials up the spin on data reform, claiming &#8216;simplified&#8217; rules will drive &#8216;responsible&#8217; data sharing<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;UK dials up the spin on data reform, claiming &#8216;simplified&#8217; rules will drive &#8216;responsible&#8217; data sharing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/09\/uk-dials-up-the-spin-on-data-reform-claiming-simplified-rules-will-drive-responsible-data-sharing\/embed\/#?secret=pbfn1qw10l\" data-secret=\"pbfn1qw10l\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>In a statement on why he&#8217;s taking the legal action,\u00a0Prismall said: &#8220;Given the very positive experience of the NHS that I have always had during my various treatments, I was greatly concerned to find that a tech giant had ended up with my confidential medical records.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;As a patient having any sort of medical treatment, the last thing you would expect is your private medical records to be in the hands of one of the world&#8217;s biggest technology companies.

Now, with production ready 2022 Rivian R1T electric pickup trucks coming off the assembly line, the final version of the kitchen is ready for prime time.<\/p>\n<p>The automaker has made a number of changes to the kitchen since it first debuted, including the addition of two supporting actors: a foundational shuttle system that the kitchen attaches to and a dishware set from Snow Peak.<\/p>\n<p>Below is video that provides an up-close look of the production-ready camp kitchen, as well as information from Josh Glaser, the company&#8217;s senior culinary program manager (aka the food guy) on how the accessory has been used and tested in Rivian&#8217;s factory.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/jf0LWv20o_4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>A few specs for you. The camp kitchen is a $5,000 optional upgrade. For a limited time, the tunnel shuttle and Snow Peak kitchen set are included. Eventually, buyers who opt for the kitchen will also have to buy the $1,500 Rivian gear tunnel shuttle option, which the kitchen sits on.<\/p>\n<p>This tunnel shuttle holds and powers the kitchen, which locks onto the platform in three sections. Rivian plans to use the shuttle for other accessories in the future. The shuttle has integrated dual power plugs \u2014 120V AC and 12V DC \u2014 and can hold up to 200 pounds when extended out from the truck.<\/p>\n<p>The kitchen, which has a richlite (a durable compressed paper resin) surface, includes a 1,440-watt two-burner induction cooktop, a nearly four-gallon water tank with a pressurized pump, collapsible and removable sink and several drawers with cork inserts to hold the 30-piece kitchen set from Snow Peak. The set includes a nylon spatula, bamboo spatula, tongs, ladle, two knives, cork screw, can opener, peeler, titanium cutlery set, tableware, stacking mugs, cutting board, two large pots, a coffee grinder, kettle and pour-over stand.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>There is even a string of lights that can be erected to provide a bit of ambiance at night.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In 2019, Rivian showed up at the Overland Expo West in Flagstaff, Arizona with a prototype of what is now known as the camp kitchen.

And for comparison&#8217;s sake, we&#8217;ll loop in both historical and present data from the Chinese startup market to see how India stacks up.<\/p>\n<h2>Venture capital in India<\/h2>\n<p>When The Exchange <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/09\/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good\/\">examined Q2 2021 data from the global venture capital market,<\/a> we leaned on <a href=\"http:\/\/cbinsights.com\">CB Insights&#8217; second-quarter data<\/a> to a large degree. That data set indicated that Indian startups raised $6.3 billion, a quarterly record.<\/p>\n<p>Today, we ran India-focused queries <a href=\"http:\/\/pitchbook.com\">in PitchBook<\/a>, keeping the data set constrained to venture-backed companies with their HQ in the country. We pulled both Q2 and Q3 numbers for this year, though, of course, the Q3 number is not quite finished; there are a few hours left.<\/p>\n<p>The PitchBook query for Q2 Indian startup fundraising activity came in a little bit above ($6.81 billion) where CB Insights pegged the data. That PitchBook has a larger number for India&#8217;s Q2 a few months <em>after<\/em> CB Insights closed the books on its Q2 report is not surprising. Venture capital data is laggy, and quarters tend to fill in over time.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless, with both $6.3 billion and $6.8 billion numbers for Indian venture capital fundraising in Q2, we have a good base to compare against for Q3.

But unlike injectable dye methods, ActivSight can visualize blood flow in real-time (i.e the images of tissue change color if blood flow slows or stops).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the only system in the world, that intraoperatively can visualize things like blood flow without the injection of any dyes,&#8221; <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">says CEO Todd Usen.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This most recent round, will be used to support the commercialization of ActivSight, which is expected to go live in hospital systems in seven states in Q4 2021 or into next year. It will also be used to help glean a CE certification \u2013 a marketing clearance that allows medical devices to be marketed in Europe \u2013 which will allow ActivSight to roll out in seven European countries in 2022. Finally, the round will support the buildout of Activ\u2019s more ambitious AI-based projects, which will allow the ActivSight devices to identify even more key structures for surgeons who use it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The round of funding was led by Cota Capital. Incuding Cota Capital, the round will bring seven new investors to Activ Surgical: BAM Funds, Magnetar Capital, Mint Ventures, Castor Ventures, Dream One Vision and NVIDIA. The company has raised $77 million in funding so far.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Activ Surgical first made headlines in 2016 for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.science.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1126\/scitranslmed.aad9398?keytype2=tf_ipsecsha&amp;ijkey=d78e1d9e122f1287c9599b650012ea86cff6b70c\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">creating a robot<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that performed the first totally autonomous suturing of soft tissue. The company\u2019s founder Peter Kim holds a patent for a type of robot assisted surgery himself. But despite this, the company isn\u2019t focused on building robots.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhile robots are great, they\u2019re only used in about 10 percent of minimally invasive surgeries. A robot can reach things that a human can\u2019t but, until this point, a robot cannot see anything that a human can\u2019t,\u201d Usen says.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, the company is investing in tools that make surgeons themselves more savvy. Usen likens ActivSight\u2019s current approach to installing a rear view camera on a car.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cYour rearview camera on your car can see things that you can\u2019t down below, then it will start beeping. When a robot can start identifying things a human can\u2019t, that\u2019s when robotics will really take off. That\u2019s what Activ is doing, and that\u2019s what our our robotic partner surgeons are excited about.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ActivSight has already shown that it can be used in the operating room. It\u2019s been <a href=\"https:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov\/ct2\/show\/NCT04633512\">tested in a\u00a0<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">clinical trial on 70 patients at the University of Texas Health Science Center and the University of Buffalo. The results of those trials have not yet been released, but the company expects to publish data from that trial in October, a company PR confirmed to TechCrunch.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the ActivSight system <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">has <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">already gleaned FDA 510(k) clearance, which means it will be rolling out in several hospital systems this year. Those include seven systems in New York, Buffalo, Texas, Ohio and Florida.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The commercial deployment of ActivSight is just the first step for Activ Surgical. The goal is to ultimately collect a unique intraoperative dataset based on surgeries completed with ActivSight.\u00a0 Then, a software suite called ActivInsight, would analyze the data collected, and apply machine learning algorithms to help identify even more features that would otherwise be invisible to surgeons.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe have the most unique dataset anywhere in the world,&#8221; says Usen.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0\u201cFrom that we\u2019re able to do autonomous annotation and label key structures. It\u2019s collecting nerve identification, veins versus arteries, key critical structures \u2013 that information will be annotated and labeled using machine learning, and then fed back to anyone using the ActivInsight module on their scope.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This machine learning application won\u2019t be rolled out right away. Usen expects ActivInsight prototypes to be used in patients for the first time in 2022.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With this round of funding, those first steps will be set in motion.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Activ Surgical, a Boston-based digital surgery company, announced a $45 million Series B round on Thursday.

closes fourth fund with $110M aimed at immigrant enterprise AI, cross-border startups"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Silicon Valley-based venture capital (VC) firm <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bgv.vc\">Benhamou Global Ventures<\/a>, known as BGV, closed its fourth fund with $110 million to support global enterprise companies.<\/p>\n<p>The new fund is 60% larger than its third fund and will be invested similarly, in seed and Series A startups focused on what general partner Anik Bose said the firm calls the \u201cEnterprise 4.0\u201d domain. That means \u201cAI-first B2B startups that apply deep tech to novel data sets coupled with workflow automation. Most importantly these startups do so without introducing unintended race, gender or age bias while addressing data privacy and security concerns and providing transparency.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe believe that the success of AI will be how effectively startups address these ethical issues,\u201d Bose added. \u201cThere is a lot of fear about AI \u2014 some people associate it with \u2018The Terminator\u2019 movie, a loss of jobs or that \u2018Big Brother\u2019 is watching, and one of the challenges that happened is that there isn&#8217;t regulation on ethics right now. We can\u2019t leave it to one company, founder or government, we all have to start doing work there.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>So far, the firm has invested in 28 companies \u2014 most recently being a part of <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/29\/customer-success-company-totango-lands-100m-growth-investment\/\">Totango\u2019s $100 million round<\/a> earlier this week, and saw 20 exits.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Bose anticipates adding 14 to 16 new companies to that list via the new fund. There have already been six investments made from the fund so far. The average check size for a seed is $2 million and $4 million for a Series A, he added.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to AI ethics, when Eric Benhamou founded the firm in 2004, he also had a vision of immigrants helping immigrants, Bose said. As such, the company has offices in Palo Alto, Tel Aviv, Paris and Mumbai. Six out of the full-time nine investment team members are immigrants, and all three general partners are immigrants. In terms of the investments, BGV\u2019s portfolio makeup is 95% immigrant entrepreneurs and 60% outside Silicon Valley.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cImmigration is a natural byproduct of our investment strategy,\u201d Bose added. \u201cWe needed a diverse team, and we have already lived the journey of the entrepreneurs we invest in. We can empathize and understand what they have to do. We also believe that today, 50% of employees are minorities, and if you have a lack of diversity, you will miss out.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote

wraps up $43M to expand its B2B gifting marketplace"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Gifting has become a major lever in the world of building business relationships in the last 20 months. With in-person meetings reduced to a trickle, sending a gift to a colleague or business associate has become a more personalized way to reward, curry favor, or just keep in touch beyond the basics of pinging each other over a messaging platform, a zoom or an email. Today, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reachdesk.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Reachdesk<\/a> &#8212; one of the companies that&#8217;s riding on the wave of that ever-expanding B2B gifting universe &#8212; is announcing that it has raised $43 million, a sign of the momentum in the space at the moment, with Reachdesk&#8217;s own business specifically growing 600% in the last year.<\/p>\n<p>Highland Europe is leading the round, a Series B round of financing, with Highland Capital, HubSpot Ventures and RLC Ventures also participating. HubSpot is a strategic backer: Reachdesk integrates with a number of CRM and other business support tools, including HubSpot&#8217;s, to help those sending gifts manage their campaigns in a more organized way.<\/p>\n<p>While the world of retail has a clear peak season for gift buying and giving that starts around Black Friday and ends just after the New Year, corporate gifting knows no start nor endpoint except for the beginning and completion (and ideally not the latter, but rather a continuing relationship) of a business association.<\/p>\n<p>So with the market on an upswing to fill the vacuum left when in-person meetings disappeared off the calendar, there have been a number of other B2B gifting startups also seeing growth and raising money to fuel that. They include <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/14\/sendoso-nabs-100m-as-its-corporate-gifting-platform-passes-20000-customers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sendoso<\/a>, which announced a $100 million round only a couple of weeks ago. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/08\/alyce-an-ai-based-personalised-corporate-gifting-startup-raises-30m\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alyce<\/a>, which raised $30 million in April for a platform it says uses AI to improve the compatibility between the occasion, the sender and the person who is receiving the gift. (That&#8217;s not a bad aim, considering that hitting the target on the gift itself and sending something that feels right can mean all the difference between getting or not getting your desired outcome as the sender.) And <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/20\/open-raises-7-2m-from-first-round-capital-and-localglobe-to-send-gifts-at-scale\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">&amp;Open<\/a> raised $7.2 million for its own twist on the model, a platform aimed specifically at sending B2B gifts at scale.<\/p>\n<p>Reachdesk was founded in London in 2019 by Alex Olley, Jay Radia, Meelan Radia and Alex Correia-Santos, with Temy Mancusi-Ungaro joining as CEO in May of this year. The idea for the company came out of the same impulse that spurred the creation of at least one of the other startups in the space: personal experience.<\/p>\n<p>Specifically, the two Radias &#8212; who are brothers &#8212; previously had co-founded Yieldify, a marketing startup that was backed by GV, among others. In that time and across other roles, they first-hand came to understand how manual the process was for gifting in the B2B world, and how it could be so much more meaningful &#8212; in the business sense, not the sentimental sense as you might have in a consumer gift &#8212; if it could be tied in with other software that people use to track and manage their business prospects and wider strategic planning.<\/p>\n<p>Mancusi-Ungaro &#8212; who is based in Reachdesk&#8217;s other big center, New York &#8212; acknowledged that there are indeed a lot of similarities between different gifting businesses &#8212; it is, after all, a very well-defined and massive space, worth some $235 billion annually in the U.S. and U.K. alone &#8212; but the key differentiator with Reachdesk, he added, is that it is being operated as a global business, which gives customers the ability to use the platform in much bigger and more consolidated campaigns. That in turn gives the startup access to serving much bigger corporate customers, in addition to smaller ones, in a more efficient manner.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The company does this by providing three main buckets for gifting options. The first of these focuses on the company&#8217;s own inventory of items, a mix of a company&#8217;s own swag and items that it curates, which Reachdesk houses in colocated warehouses in different parts of the globe. The second is a marketplace, currently with some 50 vendors, that connects gift givers with a network of gift makers that focus on, say, personalised corporate gifts. The third area is the wide world of gift cards, with no physical boxes at all. The idea is to expand all three in the future.<\/p>\n<p>While today most of the use cases for Reachdesk are still in the areas of sales and marketing, there are some emerging scenarios that speak to how it might grow, said Mancusi-Ungaro. These include more internal gifts for employees within your company; and potentially also gifts that a business might send out to its customers, B2B2C, if you would, with the &#8220;C&#8221; representing not clients, but customers of the business.

launches OSS Port open source project to help developers visualize code base"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">The larger a coding project gets, and the more people become involved, the harder it becomes to get a big picture view of how the entire project fits together, and this is especially true for distributed teams. Today, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.codesee.io\/\">CodeSee<\/a>, an early stage startup that wants to help development teams understand the entire code base, released <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oss-port.com\/\">OSS Port<\/a>, an open source project designed to help disparate open source teams do just that.<\/p>\n<p>While it was at it, the company also announced a $3 million seed round it received last year and had not revealed previously. Boldstart Ventures and Uncork Capital co-led that round with participation from DCVC, Precursor Ventures and Salesforce Ventures and several other angel investors.<\/p>\n<p>Overall CodeSee&#8217;s goal is to help companies visualize and understand their code, something that has become increasingly challenging as the sheer volume and number of developers involved grow. &#8220;CodeSee is a developer tool that helps developers and teams deeply understand how the code works,&#8221; CEO Shanea Leven, who co-founded the company with her husband CTO Josh Leven, explained.<\/p>\n<p>CEO Leven says they created an open source product for starters because they see a real need for this service in open source projects with a variety of developers from around the world, and new people joining all the time, to get a holistic sense of the code base. She believes that if CodeSee works for these projects, it will act as proof of concept of sorts for the commercial version of the product.<\/p>\n<p>Leven, who has more than a decade of experience in various levels of product management at companies like Docker and Cloudflare has seen what happens when engineering teams don&#8217;t understand the connections across the entire code base. In extreme cases, when things went wrong, it led to release deadlines slipping. As she watched this play out, she kept thinking there should be a way to help them understand how it all fits together. Eventually she decided to start a company to solve the problem.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2210266\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2210266\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2210266\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/josh-and-shanea.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"Josh Leven, CTO and Shanea Leven, CEO at CodeSee\" width=\"680\" height=\"510\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/josh-and-shanea.jpg 960w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/josh-and-shanea.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/josh-and-shanea.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/josh-and-shanea.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/josh-and-shanea.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/josh-and-shanea.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2210266\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">CodeSee founders CTO Josh Leven and CEO Shanea Leven.<strong> Image Credits:<\/strong> CodeSee<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Ed Sim, who is managing partner at lead investor Boldstart, sees this ability to understand the code base as a missing component in the development process, and one that could help companies retain engineering talent. That&#8217;s because engineers will typically leave after 12 months if they can&#8217;t master the code base.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If there&#8217;s a product to help people master the codebase [faster], and bring this visual approach to it, then we saw that it could be an absolutely massive opportunity to unlock value and to ship better code faster, and that&#8217;s what Shanea really demonstrated to us,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>As Leven and her husband built the company over the last 18 months, they now have 10 employees, and CEO Leven, who is Black, says that her personal experience led her to build a very deliberate welcoming and inclusive culture at her company. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been involved with a lot of startups. And my take on building a culture is that one of the greatest joys of being a CEO is that I get to build the inclusive culture that I wish that I [always] had,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>She added, &#8220;We don&#8217;t have the perfect ratio. We&#8217;re not perfect in any way. But we do [think about] culture as a mandatory, necessary part of our day-to-day experience. We don&#8217;t think of it separately &#8212; this is the company and this is diversity and inclusion. Diversity and inclusion is built in at a fundamental level of our company,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"R4qgsAwgo7\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/05\/19\/deep-algo-offers-simple-code-visualization-for-people-who-dont-know-how-to-code\/\">Deep Algo offers simple code visualization for people who don\u2019t know how to code<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Deep Algo offers simple code visualization for people who don\u2019t know how to code&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/05\/19\/deep-algo-offers-simple-code-visualization-for-people-who-dont-know-how-to-code\/embed\/#?secret=R4qgsAwgo7\" data-secret=\"R4qgsAwgo7\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>While the company has developed during the pandemic and is spread out geographically, she thinks often about what the company will look like as it grows, and while she is still considering it, she is thinking about building local hubs where there are clusters of employees.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There might be some kind of alternative hubs, but we will discuss that as a team and we&#8217;ll try to scale and do whatever feels right for folks, but not before vaccines come out for children,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The larger a coding project gets, and the more people become involved, the harder it becomes to get a big picture view of how the entire project fits together, and this is especially true for distributed teams.

which has built an identity operating system for banks and fintechs, announced Thursday that it has raised $100 million at a $1.35 billion valuation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lightspeed Venture Partners led the Series C round, which comes just over one year after New York-based Alloy raised $40 million in a Series B financing. Existing backers Canapi Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, Avid Ventures and Felicis Ventures all put money in the latest round, bringing Alloy\u2019s total raised to over $150 million since its 2015 inception.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/alloy.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alloy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was founded primarily to fix a \u201cbroken\u201d onboarding process that has historically involved manual review when people applied for bank accounts online. Put simply, the startup\u2019<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s initial mission was to help banks and fintechs make better identity and risk decisions using its single API service and SaaS platform.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ove<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">r the last year, Alloy has evolved that platform to not only<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">automate onboarding identity decisions but to also automate transaction monitoring and soon, credit underwriting. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also over the past 12 months, the company has seen its annual recurring revenue (ARR) triple and number of customers double, according to Alloy CFO Kiran Hebbar.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Today, the company has more than 200 clients, including Ally Bank, HMBradley, Brex, Marqeta, Gemini, Ramp and Evolve Bank &amp;<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trust &#8212; up from 90 at this time last year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alloy connects its users to data from 120 identity providers, and then uses that data to help financial institutions avoid fraud during initial customer onboarding and when conducting ongoing transactions. Questions it aims to answer for banks and fintechs include: \u201cIs this a real person? Will they defraud us?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And it does it by giving them a way to create instant decisioning systems that are customized to their needs from a regulatory compliance and risk perspective.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s really hard for fintech companies and banks to deploy products that are both safe for them, meaning they won\u2019t take on a bunch of fraud or compliance losses, but also seamless for their users,\u201d said CEO and co-founder Tommy Nicholas.<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What has historically ended up happening is that financial institutions\u2019 efforts to mitigate risk have resulted in less than ideal user experiences.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOur entire mission is to make that go away and have risk be something you can just install and put into the background to solve all the problems of users who can take money from you,\u201d Nicholas told TechCrunch. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve gotten really good at helping them automate and optimize those processes. We&#8217;re basically asking people to take the most important processes that they run and put those into one central system.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As more companies become fintechs, or rather embed things like payments into their platforms (e-commerce companies are a prime example), Alloy has seen an increase in the number of companies that could take advantage of what it does, according to Nicholas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, as mentioned above, the company has now expanded into transactional monitoring, with plans to launch a product focused on credit underwriting later this year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2209998\" style=\"width: 1314px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2209998\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2209998 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/TM-screenshot.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1304\" height=\"956\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/TM-screenshot.jpg 1304w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/TM-screenshot.jpg?resize=150,110 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/TM-screenshot.jpg?resize=300,220 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/TM-screenshot.jpg?resize=768,563 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/TM-screenshot.jpg?resize=680,499 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/TM-screenshot.jpg?resize=50,37 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1304px) 100vw, 1304px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2209998\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Alloy<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The startup plans to use its new capital mainly toward building out \u201ccontinuously evolving\u201d customer identity<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">profiles that can be used to prevent fraud and minimize risk. Down the line, Alloy plans to incorporate \u201cricher data and risk signals\u201d with the mission of giving banks and fintechs a 360-degree view of their customers. It also, simply, wants to improve the developer experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe want to make building a fintech product as easy as building an e-commerce product,\u201d Nicholas said. <\/span><b>\u201c<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Identity and its associated risk isn\u2019t something businesses should be figuring out, it<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">should just be something they install.

There&#8217;s a proliferation of the number of financial service companies, both big and small, and even to some extent some software companies, that are embedding financial services in their products\u2026.And every single one of those companies is going to need to onboard customers and go through that KYC (Know Your Customer), AML (Anti-money laundering) onboarding process initially.&#8221;<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Alloy, which has built an identity operating system for banks and fintechs, announced Thursday that it has raised $100 million at a $1.35 billion valuation.

href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/22\/spotify-to-test-paid-podcast-subscriptions-this-spring-via-new-anchor-feature\/\">began beta testing<\/a> new features to make podcasts more interactive through the use of listener polls and Q&amp;As. Today, the company says these features will become publicly available to all creators through its podcast creation app, Anchor.<\/p>\n<p>To use the new options, creators who publish and distribute using Anchor will be able to post a question or poll alongside their episode. At present, Anchor supports adding just one poll and one Q&amp;A to an individual episode, not several.<\/p>\n<p>When the podcast is published on Spotify, the polls and Q&amp;As will appear at the bottom of the podcast&#8217;s episode page on the Spotify mobile app, both iOS and Android. Listeners can then follow the prompt to respond to the poll or Q&amp;A in the app.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2210480\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2210480\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2210480\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/1920x1080_intwom-qa.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/1920x1080_intwom-qa.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/1920x1080_intwom-qa.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/1920x1080_intwom-qa.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/1920x1080_intwom-qa.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/1920x1080_intwom-qa.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/1920x1080_intwom-qa.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/1920x1080_intwom-qa.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2210480\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Spotify<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>After responding to the poll, listeners will immediately be able to view how the rest of the podcast audience voted so they can see how their own answers stacked up. But their Q&amp;A responses are delivered privately to the podcaster. The podcast creator can choose to pin specific responses that will appear publicly below the question. These will display the listener&#8217;s Spotify username, so the feature should be used with that in mind. In other words, this feature is the podcast equivalent of the radio call-in &#8212; except it&#8217;s not live or recorded audio from the listener, it&#8217;s text.<\/p>\n<p>These features have been in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/23\/spotify-adds-an-interactive-feature-for-podcasts-with-launch-of-polls\/\">testing<\/a> before today&#8217;s public launch with hundreds of creators throughout the year. During this time, the company says creators have used Q&amp;As to ask for suggestions for future guests, get feedback about topic choice and format, and add gamification elements to their programs, where listeners are encouraged to return to hear what the hosts say about the listeners&#8217; response.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2210478\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2210478\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2210478\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/1920x1080_intwom-qa-consumer.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/1920x1080_intwom-qa-consumer.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/1920x1080_intwom-qa-consumer.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/1920x1080_intwom-qa-consumer.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/1920x1080_intwom-qa-consumer.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/1920x1080_intwom-qa-consumer.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/1920x1080_intwom-qa-consumer.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/1920x1080_intwom-qa-consumer.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2210478\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Spotify<\/p><\/div><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The new features are now being made available to any Anchor creators and Spotify users in 160 markets around the world.

Electric raises $200 million at $3 billion valuation"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Ola Electric said on Thursday it has raised over $200 million in a new financing round at a valuation of $3 billion, up from <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/01\/ola-electric-softbank\/\">$1 billion two years ago<\/a>, as it looks to scale its electric vehicle manufacturing business in the South Asian market.<\/p>\n<p>Falcon Edge Capital led the financing round, the Bangalore-based startup said. SoftBank also participated in the new round, which hasn&#8217;t closed. TechCrunch reported last month that the startup was in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/30\/ola-electric-in-talks-to-raise-at-over-2-5-billion-valuation\/\">talks to raise at over $2.75 billion<\/a>\u00a0valuation.<\/p>\n<p>The fundraise follows Ola Electric recently launching its first electric scooter, called Ola S1, that is priced at 99,999 Indian rupees, or $1,350. The electric scooter offers a range of 121 kilometers (75 miles) on a complete charge. The startup said it had sold scooters worth $150 million in just two days.<\/p>\n<p>The startup, which was once the part of the ride-hailing giant Ola, said it will deploy the fresh funds to accelerate development of other vehicle platforms including electric motorbike, mass market scooter and its electric car. It&#8217;s also setting up what is the world&#8217;s largest manufacturing factory for electric scooters. The 500-acre factory in the Southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu will have a capacity to produce roughly one electric scooter every two seconds.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019re proud to lead the EV revolution from India to the world. India has the talent and the capability to build technologies of the future for the industries of the future for the entire world. I thank our existing investors and welcome new ones to Ola. Together we will bring mobility to a billion and sustainability to the future,&#8221; said Bhavish Aggarwal, founder and chief executive of Ola, in a statement. Aggarwal, pictured above, is also the founder and chief executive of Ola Electric.<\/p>\n<p>In recent quarters, Aggarwal has urged New Delhi, and players in the industry to evolve from using gasoline-powered vehicles and switch to those run by electric by 2025.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Ola is seriously exploring the public markets and may file the paperworks for an initial public offering this year. Ahead of it, the startup recently <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/08\/temasek-and-warburg-pincus-invest-500-million-in-ola\/\">closed a $500 million financing round<\/a> from Temasek, Warburg Pincus, and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/29\/meesho-india-social-commerce-raises-570-million\/\">Aggarwal<\/a>.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>India&#8217;s startup ecosystem, a journey which kickstarted in late 2000s, is finally beginning to produce firms that have matured to stages where they can become public companies. And retail investors are showing great interest, too.<\/p>\n<p>Food delivery startup Zomato had a stellar debut on Indian stock exchanges earlier this year. Scores of other firms including Paytm, MobiKwik, CarTrade, Nykaa, and PolicyBazaar have filed the paperworks for their initial public offerings. Indian hospitality giant Oyo is expected to follow suit as soon as this week, TechCrunch <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/22\/indias-oyo-to-file-for-1-billion-ipo\/\">reported earlier<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Barring Oyo publishing its IPO paperwork later today, Ola&#8217;s announcement caps a buzzy day for the Indian startup ecosystem. Social commerce firm Meesho earlier today said it had raised $570 million in a round led by B Capital Group and Fidelity. The round valued Meesho at $4.9 billion, up from $2.1 billion value it had been priced at in its previous funding round in April.<\/p>\n<p>OfBusiness, a business-to-business commerce unveiled this afternoon that it had <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/30\/tiger-global-backs-india-ofbusiness-at-3-billion-valuation\/\">raised over $200 million<\/a>, too, in a round led by Tiger Global. Like Ola Electric, OfBusiness is now <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/29\/meesho-india-social-commerce-raises-570-million\/\">also valued at $3 billion<\/a>. The startup&#8217;s equity was priced at $800 million in April this year.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ola Electric said on Thursday it has raised over $200 million in a new financing round at a valuation of $3 billion, up from $1 billion two years ago, as it looks to scale its electric vehicle manufacturing business in the South Asian market.

F round, and SoftBank and Alpha Wave participated in it, OfBusiness co-founder and chief executive Asish Mohapatra told us. The new investment comes just two months after SoftBank led a $160 million round in OfBusiness at a $1.5 billion valuation.<\/p>\n<p>Thursday\u2019s announcement is the third financing round for OfBusiness this year. The startup, whose business has grown multiple folds this year, was valued at $800 million in April this year.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/ofbusiness.com\">OfBusiness<\/a> operates as a raw material aggregator and procurement finance provider. The startup works with banks to offer credit lines to small and medium enterprises that have an annual turnover of over $3 million.<\/p>\n<p>The platform collects data on user activity that it relies on to underwrite loans to businesses that are using the OfBusiness platform for sourcing raw material and tenders.\u00a0\u201cThis enables us to move from collateral based loans to cash-flow\/ transaction-based lending \u2013 a key differentiator to banks,&#8221; Mohapatra told Bernstein analysts last year.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The SMEs pay interest on their working capital loan (issued in form of card limits), and a margin on the raw material procured. Bid-Assist platform is a repository for SMEs to look up tenders suitable for their business. The tender sourcing and raw material margin provide better monetization and more importantly, predictive data useful for underwriting.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The startup&#8217;s revenue run-rate is over $1 billion, and it&#8217;s profitable. By July this year, its loan book size had increased to $220 million.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>\u201cWe provide credit lines, akin to cash-credit\/ overdraft. Borrowers pay interest only on the limits drawn and are required to procure raw material from the platform. This provides us with a view on end-use of the loan and data for fresh underwriting and monitoring. Borrowers using leverage for inventory are better than those using loans to pay off old loans.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The startup plans to deploy the fresh funds to expand its operations in India. OfBusiness is also eyeing merger and acquisitions opportunities, the startup said.<\/p>\n<p>OfBusiness is Tiger Global&#8217;s latest investment in India.

focused on weight care management, is emerging from stealth today with $32 million in total funding and the news that it has appointed former Bumble COO Sarah Jones Simmer as its new chief executive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/joinfound.com\/pages\/new-home-page\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Found<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was incubated at <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/02\/atomic-which-only-funds-the-startups-it-launches-just-closed-its-newest-fund-with-260-million\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Atomic<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a San Francisco-based venture studio in the spring of 2020. Earlier this year, it raised $24 million in a Series A round led by GV (formerly Google Ventures) and Atomic, with participation from Define Ventures. And over the course of the last year, it raised $8 million in previously unannounced seed funding, largely from Atomic in addition to Define Ventures.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jack Abraham, co-founder of Found and Atomic managing partner, said the startup was built to address the \u201cchallenging\u201d issue of weight care while incorporating telehealth. (Abraham also is a co-founder of hims and hers, a telehealth service for wellness and care.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With over 70% of the population overweight or obese and these numbers increasing at a concerning rate, we saw a need for a personalized, science-based approach to help bend the curve,\u201d said Abraham, who initially started Found with Atomic&#8217;s Emily Yudofsky.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And while some point solutions exist for a specific medication or treatment, Abraham added, Found was started in an effort to offer \u201ca comprehensive, tailored, and precision-based solution to help anyone looking to lose weight.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By comprehensive, he means that the startup draws from \u201cdozens\u201d of medications, supplements, diet plans, exercise routines and coaching programs to help its members achieve their personal weight and health goals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since its 2020 launch, Found has helped \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of members lose over 200,000 pounds, according to co-founder and COO Swathy Prithivi, who had served as the company\u2019s interim CEO before Jones Simmer\u2019s hiring earlier this month. It is currently available in 31 states at an average cost of $100 per month with a variety of plans.<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cA lot of what spurred creating Found was that obesity is a disease, not a decision, and that it&#8217;s time that we modernized weight care so that obesity is treated like a disease and not a decision,\u201d she told TechCrunch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Weight, continued Prithivi, is \u201cdeeply stigmatized\u201d as a category.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe&#8217;ve all been told to eat less and move more, and then shamed for our lack of willpower when we don&#8217;t see success,\u201d she said, \u201cbut there&#8217;s very little success to be seen when 50% of the U.S. is on diets but only 5% lose weight. And this is despite decades of research that show us that losing weight and keeping it off is more than just diet and working out.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Found, she said, aims to help people focus more on body positivity and what they can \u201cfind\u201d &#8212; such as being able to finish a 5K or keeping up with their grandkids or a newfound confidence &#8212; during their weight management journey. And it does it by combining advice from clinicians, a community of others going through the same process and \u201cprescription interventions\u201d when deemed necessary. The company aims for a holistic, personalized and integrated approach that includes addressing sleep, \u201cmindful\u201d eating, movement, stress and a person\u2019s biology.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jones Simmer comes to Found from Bumble, where she laid the foundation for<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0that company\u2019s entire initial public offering. During that process, she was battling Stage 3 breast cancer &#8212; doing drafts of the S-1 from a chemo chair and sending it to the board the morning of her double mastectomy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The move to Found from a company she\u2019d worked at from its early days of being founded out of a two-bedroom apartment was, in large part, a personal one that stemmed from her experience in battling cancer. She was also drawn to the company\u2019s mission to fight stigma around obesity and weight loss in a similar way that Bumble fought stigmas around online dating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> entered remission very shortly after the IPO, and after a pretty grueling year or so of treatment that I think was like, 20-plus rounds of chemo, multiple surgeries and 37 rounds of radiation,\u201d Jones Simmer said. \u201c All of that really causes you to reflect on how you want to spend your days and what&#8217;s important to you.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So despite her deep respect for Bumble CEO and founder Whitney Wolfe Herd, and love for the company and team, Jones Simmer left Bumble earlier this year because she wanted to \u201ctake a bet\u201d on herself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAt one point during my fight with cancer, my doctor gave me a timeline that made me reconsider whether I had a lifetime to achieve my personal and professional goals,\u201d she said. \u201cMy prognosis looks better now, but my viewpoint has changed permanently.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plus, she says, she missed building and wanted to go back to something earlier stage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI wanted the chance to integrate the lessons I learned at Bumble and really think about building something else that had a similar opportunity for impact and that could touch people&#8217;s lives,\u201d Jones Simmer told TechCrunch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, Found has 130 employees, including its coaching staff, and a large part of its capital will go toward expanding its headcount. The company also announced today that it has named Alexandre Linares as its new chief product officer. Linares previously served as the VP of product at Headspace, where he oversaw product and growth for the app, which today serves an estimated 70 million people. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GV Partner<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gv.com\/team\/frederique-dame\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Frederique Dame<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, who has also invested in the likes of Pill Club and Kindbody, has joined Found\u2019s board as part of the Series A.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She said she backed Found because its mission resonated with her.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cFound takes a fresh approach to helping people lose weight, bringing the weight clinic model online with personalized, evidence-based coaching designed to improve patient outcomes,\u201d wrote Dame via email.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, Dame and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prithivi worked closely together at Uber from 2012 to 2016.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI always admired her focus and dedication to operational excellence,\u201d Dame said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Found, she believes, is unique in two key ways. For one, its toolkit\u2019s diversity. And second, its approach to stigma and attempting to shift the narrative around weight management.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s the most integrated platform, and the most tailored to your needs,\u201d Dame told TechCrunch. \u201cAnd, Found makes access to care easy and convenient, while emphasizing body positivity and self acceptance.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em>The article was updated post-publication to reflect that Austin is not its headquarters.

a vast amount of high-density data and information overload and are vulnerable to security issues due to the limited space for storage. There is also an expensive cost issue when it comes to transmitting the stored data.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To solve the problems of traditional electronic media, a startup in Boston, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.catalogdna.com\/\">Catalog<\/a>, was founded in 2016 by MIT scientists including co-founder and CEO Hyunjun Park, developing an energy efficient, cost competitive, and more secure data storage and computation platform by using synthetic DNA.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The startup announced today it has secured a $35 million Series B round to continue developing its DNA-based data computation tools.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">South Korea\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.hanwhaimpact.com\/m\/en\/index\">Hanwha Impact<\/a> led the Series B round and was joined by existing backer Hong Kong-based Li Ka-Shing&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/horizonsventures.com\/\">Horizons Ventures<\/a>, CEO Hyunjun Park said in an interview with TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The latest funding will be used to accelerate development of Catalog&#8217;s synthetic <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/DNA_computing\">DNA-powered computing<\/a> platform, which enables data management, computation, and automation. Over the next two to three years, Catalog also plans to put more investment into developing computation functions, Park told TechCrunch. The platform is expected to be commercialized around 2025, Park said.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company, which is a member of <a href=\"https:\/\/dnastoragealliance.org\/\">DNA Storage Alliance<\/a>, will continue to support collaborators and partners of the DNA-based computing system for helping the industry grow, according to Park.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Series B brings its total funding up to approximately $60 million; Park declined to disclose its valuation. This round comes after a $10 million Series A led by Horizons Ventures in 2020 and a $9 million seed round in 2018 co-led by New Enterprise Associates and <a href=\"https:\/\/osfund.co\/\">OS Fund<\/a>\u00a0and other investors, Park said.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the concept of using DNA as a medium for data storage and computing has been around for years, a lot of the work has been relegated to the academic realm. Catalog has discovered the means to incorporate DNA into algorithms and applications with potential widespread commercial use through its proprietary data encoding scheme to automation.<\/p>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\">&#8220;Catalog&#8217;s proprietary approach to writing information into DNA, namely its encoding scheme, is revolutionary in that minimal de novo DNA synthesis is required to store a tremendous amount of information. Because the low speed and high cost of DNA synthesis have traditionally been the bottleneck in this field,&#8221; Park explained.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Catalog\u2019s custom-developed DNA writer, Shannon, is capable of hundreds and thousands of chemical reactions per second. Shannon, which is designed to write at a speed of over 10Mb\/sec at full capacity, stores up to 1.63Tb of compressed data in a single run.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expected applications for Catalog&#8217;s technology include fraud detection in financial services, image processing for defect discovery in manufacturing, and digital signal processing such as seismic processing in the energy sector.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cCatalog has worked with companies in IT, media, entertainment, and energy sectors. Through this work, we have discovered the broad applicability of our [DNA-based data storage and computing] platform across industries and heavy data users,\u201d Park said. He added that the dozen or so companies working as co-development partners and collaborators are based in the US and Europe.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IT industry has witnessed a proliferation of purpose-fit technologies over the last several years, including accelerators (GPUs, FPGAs), quantum computers, as well as extreme parallel computers. The advent of the DNA-based computer complements this portfolio, emphasizing low-energy, spatially dense, and secure computing, divorced from the realities and limitations of electronic systems, as per its statement.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAs a reference point, the high-performance computing market is currently about $40 billion annually, and growing rapidly,\u201d Park said when asked regarding the global market size.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cCompanies including Microsoft, Twist, Illumina, and Western Digital formed the DNA Storage Alliance earlier this year. Catalog is a member of this organization and is taking this to the next level by focusing on computation and thereby enabling enterprises to generate business value from data that otherwise would have been thrown away or left in cold storage,\u201d Park said.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cCatalog\u2019s technology represents a viable pathway to solve the issue of not only mass data accumulation and preservation but more importantly, the effective usage of data,\u201d said Nick Ha, vice president of Hanwha Impact Partners.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Early this year, Catalog opened an office in Seoul, South Korea, a wholly subsidiary of Catalog, for Asia expansion, Park noted.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"VlehmKfStQ\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/04\/27\/genetics-startup-twist-bioscience-teams-up-with-microsoft-to-store-the-worlds-data-in-dna\/\">Genetics startup Twist Bioscience is working with Microsoft to store the world\u2019s data in DNA<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Genetics startup Twist Bioscience is working with Microsoft to store the world\u2019s data in DNA&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/04\/27\/genetics-startup-twist-bioscience-teams-up-with-microsoft-to-store-the-worlds-data-in-dna\/embed\/#?secret=VlehmKfStQ\" data-secret=\"VlehmKfStQ\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Conventional electronic media like flash drives and hard drives require energy consumption to process a vast amount of high-density data and information overload and are vulnerable to security issues due to the limited space for storage.

The hard truth is that RPA is a decades-old technology that is brittle with real limits to its capabilities. It will always have some value in automating work that is simple, discrete, and linear. However, the reason automation efforts often fall short of their aspirations is because so much of life is complex and constantly evolving &#8211; too much work falls outside of the capabilities of RPA. In this talk, Varun Ganapathi, Ph.D., Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer of AKASA will discuss how exceptions and outliers can actually make automation stronger and how emerging machine-learning-based technology platforms combined with human-in-the-loop approaches are already expanding what it is possible to automate across a number of industries.","title":"Future Forward: How Machine Learning and Human-in-the-Loop Approaches Are Expanding the Capabilities of Automation","videoUrl":"","sessionTypeId":0,"speakers":[{"name":"Varun Ganapathi","uuid":"564d8e601f91776b9ce6201af27cc6271632424483","cb_tag":576924146}],"sponsors":[{"address":{"city":"","country":"","state":"","street1":"","street2":"","zip":""},"categories":[],"content":"AKASA is building the future of healthcare with AI.
